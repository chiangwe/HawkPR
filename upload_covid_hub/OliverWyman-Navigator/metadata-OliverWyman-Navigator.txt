methods_long: 'Oliver Wyman''s COVID-19 Pandemic Navigator provides forecasts and
  scenario analysis for Detected and Undetected cases and deaths. Our compartmental
  models are based on a discrete form of nonlinear differential equations, parameterized
  with dynamic functions (i.e. time-dependent transition rates) that incorporate:
  (1) the modeled effects of physical distancing and government actions; (2) evolving
  testing practices in terms of timeliness and scale; (3) the link to tracking and
  contact tracing, and (4) other region-specific characteristics. Our formulation
  draws on core methods from both epidemiology and physics. It is data-driven to characterize
  non-linear transition rates and posits underlying causal mechanisms that we have
  verified against mobility indices representing physical distancing in mass scale
  and government response actions.  Our models recalibrate daily with the arrival
  of new information on COVID-19.  By design, the calibration of our models use region-specific
  data, as the differences in the timing and execution of government restrictions,
  testing, population density, social behaviour norms and public responses, re-opening
  plans, and demographics are extremely relevant. Additional details on our approach,
  as well as selected forecast results, can be found at: https://pandemicnavigator.oliverwyman.com/'
