team_model_designation: primary
methods: 'Data-driven approach based on deep learning for forecasting mortality and  hospitalizations
  using syndromic, clinical, demographic, and mobility. '
team_funding: Partly supported by multiple grants from NSF  (NSF CAREER, NSF CISE
  Expeditions, NSF IIS, NSF COVID RAPID) and GA Tech
data_inputs: COVID Tracking Project, JHU, COVID-Net, NYT,
  demographic, mobility and symptomatic data
methods_long: May 11 - This data-driven deep learning model learns the dependence
  of hospitalization and mortality rate on various detailed syndromic, demographic,
  mobility and clinical data (such as increase in positive Covid tests etc) from historical
  data. The learned model is then used to predict mortality and hospitalization at
  various points in future. To compensate for the effects of noise (in data and initialization),
  the model is bootstrapped on several subsamples and then aggregated. The model also
  propagates uncertainties in the data to show the confidence intervals in the forecasts.
