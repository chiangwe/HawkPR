data_inputs: cumulative and incident death forecasts from other models.
methods_long: 'April 13: At state level, only two models included in first week, LANL
  and IHME, due to overlaps in location and reported quantiles. At national level,
  IHME was combined with the three CU models. April 27: Different component models
  at state level and national level. Please see the model information file for more
  details. May 4: National ensemble combined 7 models, state ensembles combined between
  2 and 8 models. For details, see ensemble-metadata/state-weight-information.csv
  All ensembles were equally weighted among all eligible models. May 19: See ensemble-metadata/2020-05-19-model-eligibility.csv
  for models included/excluded at each location with reasons, and ensemble-metadata/2020-05-19-model-weights.csv
  for weights by location. May 26: See ensemble-metadata folder for models included/excluded
  in each location, and weights by location. July 28: switched to using a per-quantile
  median prediction across all eligible models. For cumulative deaths, we still implemented
  the automated checks that the 10th percentile of the 1-week ahead predictive distribution
  must be at least the most recent observed cumulative death, and the quantiles must be
  non-decreasing over time at each quantile level. We did not eliminate any models based on
  visual misalignment with the reference JHU data this week.'
