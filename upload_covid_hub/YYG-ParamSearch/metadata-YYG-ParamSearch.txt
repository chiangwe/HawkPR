methods_long: 'We''ve built a SEIR model with learned parameters to make daily
  projections regarding COVID-19 infections and deaths in all 50 US states and
  70+ countries. The model also accounts for individual state-by-state reopenings
  and the resulting effects on infections and deaths. The parameters/inputs
  of this simulator are learned using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes
  the error between the projected outputs (projected daily deaths) and the actual
  results (reported daily deaths). Because the infections curve is unique for every
  region, we let the model use each region''s own data to learn the best set of parameters
  for that region. This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0,
  post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns. Other variables such
  as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are fixed based
  on published literature. After some additional validation techniques to minimize
  overfitting, we use the learned parameters to simulate the future and make
  projections. See website for full description, methods, and results.'
