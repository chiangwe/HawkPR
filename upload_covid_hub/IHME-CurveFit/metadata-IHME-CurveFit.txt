methods_long: 'This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on
  the assumption  that current interventions continue. The modeling approach in this
  study is divided into four components:  (i) identification and processing of COVID-19
  data;  (ii) statistical model estimation for population death rates as a function
  of time  since the death rate exceeds a threshold in a location;  (iii) predicting
  time to exceed a given population death threshold in states early in the pandemic;
  and  (iv) modeling health service utilization as a function of deaths." CurveFit
