methods: 'SIR mechanistic model with data assimilation.  '
methods_long: 'EpiCovDA is an extension of the EpiGro model. Model parameters are
  fit to Covid-19 data using a variational data assimilation method. A prior distribution
  of the parameters is estimated by fitting an SIR Incidence-Cumulative Cases curve
  to data from states that had at least 1000 cases by 04/01/2020. See <https://jocelinelega.github.io/EpiGro/>
